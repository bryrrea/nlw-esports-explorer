This is an online event promoted by Rocketseat, a Brazilian coding school. It's the 10th edition of this hands-on event!  
Trying to reach everyone, it was offered two paths: for beginners, they offered the "Mission: Explorer", and for those who already knows something about development, they offered the "Mission: Ignite".  

## Mission: Explorer  

### Project: Game Hub  

"Mission: Explorer" brought a front-end project which every beginner would be able to create a game hub. Using a style which reminds Linktree, this hub was supposed to show the games liked by the creator, the Twitch channels and streamer that he/she liked, and the social medias of the creator.  
The figure below shows an example of the project.

## Mission: Ignite  

### Project: Find your duo  

"Mission: Ignite" brought a fullstack web and mobile platform that helps gamers find a partner to play their favorite game online, connected to Twitch.  
The figure below shows an example of the project in both versions (landing page of the web app and home of mobile app).

My path was "Mission: Explorer". I learnt a lot with the educator [@Mayk Brito](https://github.com/maykbrito) and all [Rocketseat's Discord community!](https://discord.com/channels/327861810768117763/1013907431857868972) So, on this repo, you will find my project developed during this event. You can see a screenshot down below, but you should look it at my [github page](https://bryrrea.github.io/nlw-esports-explorer) either!  Please, let me know what you think about it! Sign in my guestbook and tell me what you think about the project, life, or even to chat. If you want to find me on social media, there are links in my page and in my github profile for it! See ya'!
