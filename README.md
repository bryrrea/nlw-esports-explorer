![Visitors](https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbryrrea%2Fnlw%2F&label=Visitors&labelColor=%23192bc2&countColor=%23449dd1&style=flat)  

This is an online event promoted by Rocketseat, a Brazilian coding school. It's the 10th edition of this hands-on event!  
Trying to reach everyone, it was offered two paths: for beginners, they offered the "Mission: Explorer", and for those who already knows something about development, they offered the "Mission: Ignite".  

## Mission: Explorer  

### Project: Game Hub  

"Mission: Explorer" brought a front-end project which every beginner would be able to create a game hub. Using a style that reminds Linktree, this hub was supposed to show the games the creator likes, the Twitch channels and streamers that he/she likes, and the social medias of the creator.  
The figure below shows an example of the project.

## Mission: Ignite  

### Project: Find your duo  

"Mission: Ignite" brought a fullstack web and mobile platform that helps gamers find a partner to play their favorite game online, connected to Twitch.  
The figure below shows an example of the project in both versions (landing page of the web app, and home of mobile app).

My path was "Mission: Explorer". I learnt a lot with the educator [@Mayk Brito](https://github.com/maykbrito) and all [Rocketseat's community in Discord!](https://discord.com/channels/327861810768117763/1013907431857868972) So, in this repo, you will find my project developed during this event. You can see a screenshot down below, but you should look it at my [page](https://bryrrea.github.io/nlw-esports-explorer) either!
